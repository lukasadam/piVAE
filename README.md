# piVAE

piVAE is a variational autoencoder, which learns a lower dimensional embeddings of function classes facilitating the encoding of stochastic priors. 

This repository only contains the rebuild code basis for a piVAE. The concept and idea was taken from the Arxiv preprint (Mishra, Swapnil, Seth Flaxman, and Samir Bhatt. "$\pi $ VAE: Encoding stochastic process priors with variational autoencoders." arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.06873 (2020).), which can be found under the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06873.pdf.

This repository is an on-going work and there is no warranty for proper functioning.
